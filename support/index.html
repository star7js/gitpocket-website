      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How do I sign in?</h3>
      <p>
        Tap the "Sign in with GitHub" button on the welcome screen. You'll be redirected to GitHub
        to authorize GitPocket. Once authorized, you'll be signed in automatically.
      </p>

      <h3>Is my GitHub token secure?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Your OAuth token is stored in iOS Keychain, which uses hardware-level encryption.
        The token never leaves your device and is only used to communicate directly with GitHub's API.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use GitPocket offline?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, to an extent. GitPocket caches repository data, gists, and releases locally so you
        can browse previously viewed content offline. However, you need an internet connection
        to fetch new data or perform actions like creating gists.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I create a gist from another app?</h3>
      <p>
        Use the iOS Share Extension: Select text in any app → tap Share → choose GitPocket.
        You can then create a new gist with the selected content.
      </p>

      <h3>Does GitPocket support GitHub Enterprise?</h3>
      <p>
        Not currently. GitPocket only supports github.com accounts at this time.
        GitHub Enterprise support may be added in a future update.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I sign out?</h3>
      <p>
        Go to Settings (tap your profile icon) → scroll down → tap "Sign Out".
        This will remove your OAuth token and clear all cached data.
      </p>

      <h3>Why can't I push code or create repositories?</h3>
      <p>
        GitPocket is currently a read-only client with limited write capabilities (gists only).
        Full repository management features may be added in future updates based on user feedback.
